**Added**
- Add support for Rules Configs endpoints  [\#552](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.net/pull/552) ([caldwell0414](https://github.com/caldwell0414))

**Changed**
- Add ID Token validation to device-code and passwordless  [\#553](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.net/pull/553) ([frederikprijck](https://github.com/frederikprijck))

**Note** that with this release, ID Token validation has been added when retrieving a token using any of the Device Code or Passwordless flows.
There might be a rare occasion where this could break your application, in the situation where you are using invalid ID Tokens.
However, typically this should not cause any issues as ID Tokens are supposed to be valid. If they aren't, you probably want to get notified about it as soon as possible.

Prior to this change, those methods would return the tokens without checking the validaty of your ID Token.
However, given the fact that this should realy be an edge case, and we believe it's a good idea to inform you about invalid tokens sooner rather than later, we decided to introduce this change in a minor release.

to ensure the return type matches the return type of the updated UserClient.GetPermissionsAsync method.

There are many breaking changes in this release. Please see our Migration Guide for v7 at
https://auth0.github.io/auth0.net/migrating.html

The summary of changes is:

- Authentication SDK includes new ID Token Validation. If your application uses HS256
signing you should set either SigningAlgorithm to SigningAlgorithm.HS256 on requests
you make to AuthenticationApiClient or switch to RS256 if your application is not confidential.

- Improved testing and mocking support. You can now mock `IAuthenticationConnection` /
`IManagementConnection` classes to provide local unit-testing functionality for
`AuthenticationApiClient` and `ManagementApiClient` respectively.

- Many classes moved namespace and assembly primarily ones in `Core` that were around paging.
Visual Studio should be able to suggest where classes you were using now reside.

- Disposal is now consistent. If `AuthenticationApiClient` or `ManagementApiClient` create a
connection for you they will manage its lifecycle. If you pass in a connection then it will be your
responsibility to manage it. This also applies to how `HttpClientAuthenticationConnection` and
`HttpClientManagementConnection` will only dispose of a `HttpClient` they create and not ones they
are given.

- Rate Limiting information is now only available on the `RateLimitApiException` which is raised when
the rate limit is exceeded.

- `ApiException` is now `ErrorApiException`. If you use the status code or error message on exception
you will need to switch to catching the later. The former is now a base class that does not have
this information but ensures any old catch `ApiException` will continue to catch rate limit
exceptions which also now inherit from this class.

- Microsoft recommends `HttpClient` is reused as much as possible.  Therefore you should use
dependency injection or inversion of control to ensure that either a single instance of
`AuthenticationApiClient` / `ManagementApiClient` or its connections `HttpClientXConnection` are
created to ensure sharing.  These classes are now thread-safe. You can additionally share
`HttpClient` objects between them if you wish by injecting it into the `HttpClientXConnection`
constructor.

- Connections now have DisplayName, Realms and IsDomainConnection properties.
