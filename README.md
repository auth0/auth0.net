## Documentation

- [Docs site](https://www.auth0.com/docs) - explore our docs site and learn more about Auth0.

## Getting started

### Requirements
This library supports .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.5.2 as well as later versions of both.

### Management API

#### Installation

```powershell
Install-Package Auth0.ManagementApi
```

#### Usage

Generate a token for the API calls you wish to make (see [Access Tokens for the Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/tokens)). Create an instance of the `ManagementApiClient` class with the token and the API URL of your Auth0 instance:

```csharp
var client = new ManagementApiClient("your token", new Uri("https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/api/v2"));
```

The API calls are divided into groups which correlate to the [Management API documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api/v2). For example all Connection related methods can be found under the `ManagementApiClient.Connections` property. So to get a list of all database (Auth0) connections, you can make the following API call:

```csharp
await client.Connections.GetAllAsync("auth0");
```

### Authentication API

#### Installation

```powershell
Install-Package Auth0.AuthenticationApi
```

#### Usage

To use the Authentication API, create a new instance of the `AuthenticationApiClient` class, passing in the URL of your Auth0 instance, e.g.:

```csharp
var client = new AuthenticationApiClient(new Uri("https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN"));
```

#### Authentication

This library contains [URL Builders](https://auth0.github.io/auth0.net/#using-url-builders) which will assist you with constructing an authentication URL, but does not actually handle the authentication/authorization flow for you. It is suggested that you refer to the [Quickstart tutorials](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstarts) for guidance on how to implement authentication for your specific platform.

**Important note on state validation**: If you choose to use the [AuthorizationUrlBuilder](https://auth0.github.io/auth0.net/api/Auth0.AuthenticationApi.Builders.AuthorizationUrlBuilder.html) to construct the authorization URL and implement a login flow callback yourself, it is important to generate and store a state value (using [WithState](https://auth0.github.io/auth0.net/api/Auth0.AuthenticationApi.Builders.AuthorizationUrlBuilder.html#Auth0_AuthenticationApi_Builders_AuthorizationUrlBuilder_WithState_System_String_)) and validate it in your callback URL before exchanging the authorization code for the tokens.
