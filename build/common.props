      Version 7.0.0-beta.1
      Many breaking changes. A migration guide will be produced while the beta runs and
      made available before GA.  The summary is:

      - Authentication SDK includes all-new ID Token Validation which will now validate H256.
        - If your app is configured for HS256 and is confidential such as a web server then you will
          need to set SigningAlgorithm to SigningAlgorithm.HS256 on your AuthenticationApiClient requests.
        - If your app is configured for HS256 and is NOT confidential such as a native client you should
          reconfigure your app for RS256 as soon as possible.
        - If your app is configured for RS256 no changes are required.  JWKS caches are now only valid for
          10 minutes and will not cache the JWKS keys indefinitely.

      - Improved testing and mocking support. You can now mock IAuthenticationConnection and/or
        IManagementConnection classes to provide local unit-testing functionality against 
        AuthenticationApiClient and ManagementApiClient respectively.  Each has just two methods that can be
        mocked - one for GET and one for other HTTP verbs.

      - Many classes moved namespace especially ones that were in "Core" as part of the long-term plan to
        only have AuthenticationApi and ManagementApi packages.  Visual Studio should be able to suggest where
        classed you were using now reside.

      - Disposal is now more consistent. If an AuthenticationApiClient or ManagementApiClient create a
        connection for you they will manage its lifecycle. If you pass in a connection then it will be your
        responsibility to manage it. This also applies to how HttpClientAuthenticationConnection and 
        HttpClientManagementConnection will only dispose of HttpClients they create and not ones they are given.

      - Rate Limiting information is now only available on the RateLimitApiException which is raised when
        the rate limit is exceeded.
        
      - ApiException is now ErrorApiException. If you relied on the status code or error message of this exception
        you will need to switch to catching the later. The former is now a base class without this information
        that ensures any old catch ApiException will continue to catch rate limit exceptions which also now
        inherit from this class.

      - Microsoft recommend HttpClient is reused as much as possible.  Therefore you should use dependency
        injection or inversion of control to ensure that either a single instance of AuthenticationApiClient /
        ManagementApiClient or it's connections HttpClient*Connection are create to ensure sharing.  These
        classes are now thread-safe. You can additionally share HttpClient objects between them if you wish
        by injecting it into the HttpClient*Connection constructor.
