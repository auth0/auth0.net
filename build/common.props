      Version 7.0.4
      - Ensure JWKS keys are cached for the correct period.
      - Raise RateLimitApiException on 429/TooManyRequests status code response.

      Version 7.0.3
      - Fixed path encoding allowing ResourceServers.GetAsync to work with HTTP URLs #377
      - Add support for extra error properties to faciliate mfa_required etc. #376

      Version 7.0.2
      - Fixed a concurrency issue - missing ConfigureAwait(false) in HttpClient*Connections.

      Version 7.0.1
      - Fixes request message disposal issue in HttpClient*Connection.GetAsync on .NET Framework 4.x

      Version 7.0.0

      There are many breaking changes in this release. Please see our Migration Guide for v7 at
      https://auth0.github.io/auth0.net/migrating.html

      The summary of changes is:

      - Authentication SDK includes new ID Token Validation. If your application uses HS256
        signing you should set either SigningAlgorithm to SigningAlgorithm.HS256 on requests
        you make to AuthenticationApiClient or switch to RS256 if your application is not confidential.

      - Improved testing and mocking support. You can now mock `IAuthenticationConnection` /
        `IManagementConnection` classes to provide local unit-testing functionality for
        `AuthenticationApiClient` and `ManagementApiClient` respectively.

      - Many classes moved namespace and assembly primarily ones in `Core` that were around paging.
        Visual Studio should be able to suggest where classes you were using now reside.

      - Disposal is now consistent. If `AuthenticationApiClient` or `ManagementApiClient` create a
        connection for you they will manage its lifecycle. If you pass in a connection then it will be your
        responsibility to manage it. This also applies to how `HttpClientAuthenticationConnection` and
        `HttpClientManagementConnection` will only dispose of a `HttpClient` they create and not ones they
        are given.

      - Rate Limiting information is now only available on the `RateLimitApiException` which is raised when
        the rate limit is exceeded.

      - `ApiException` is now `ErrorApiException`. If you use the status code or error message on exception
        you will need to switch to catching the later. The former is now a base class that does not have
        this information but ensures any old catch `ApiException` will continue to catch rate limit
        exceptions which also now inherit from this class.

      - Microsoft recommends `HttpClient` is reused as much as possible.  Therefore you should use
        dependency injection or inversion of control to ensure that either a single instance of
        `AuthenticationApiClient` / `ManagementApiClient` or its connections `HttpClientXConnection` are
        created to ensure sharing.  These classes are now thread-safe. You can additionally share
        `HttpClient` objects between them if you wish by injecting it into the `HttpClientXConnection`
        constructor.

      - Connections now have DisplayName, Realms and IsDomainConnection properties.

      Version 6.5.5
      - Signup API result now handles custom databases returning variations of "id" name
      - Fix EnrollmentAuthMethod.Authenticator enum name
      - ClientBase now has property for `initiate_login_uri`

      Version 6.5.4
      - SECURITY FIX for CVE-2019-16929. See
        https://github.com/auth0/auth0.net/blob/master/SECURITY-NOTICE.md#idtokenvalidator-public for more details.

      Version 6.5.3
      WARNING: If you generate tokens in your project via System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt
      please read the important notice at https://github.com/auth0/auth0.net/issues/300

      - Upgraded System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt to 5.5 to fix incompatible kid
      - Upgraded Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.OpenIdConnect to 5.5
      - Add ClientId to VerifyEmailJobRequest
      - Updated all test dependencies (xunit, FluentAssertions, .NET Test SDK)
      - Removed unused Console Workbench project

      Version 6.5.2
      - UserClient.GetEnrollments now correctly passes user id.

      Version 6.5.1
      - User and role permissions endpoints in UsersClient and RolesClient paging fix.

      Version 6.5.0
      - Assembly is now strong-name-signed so it can be used by other strong-name-signed packages.
      - NOTE: This is code signing only using a non-secret key. It is not authenticode or tamper protection.
      - User and role permissions endpoints in UsersClient and RolesClient now correctly honoring paging.
      - User model optional fields (CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, LastLogin) are now nullable.

      Version 6.4.0
      - TenantSettings lifetimes are now double not integer.
      - Added various Guardian-related endpoints on UserClient.
