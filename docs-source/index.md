# Auth0 .NET SDK

## Description

Welcome to the documentation for the Auth0 .NET SDK. This reference will give you basic guidance on how to use the .NET SDK to access the Auth0 Management API and Authentication API.

This documentation is supplemental to the official [Auth0 API documentation](https://auth0.com/docs). For more information on the Authentication and Management APIs, you should also refer to the official documentation:

* [Authentication API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication)
* [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2)

The rest of this documentation will guide your through the process of installing the various NuGet Packages, as well as some basic examples. You will also find the full references for all the classes and types in the Auth0 .NET SDK.

## Installation

You can install the Auth0 .NET SDK through [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org). Two different NuGet packages are available, one for the Authentication API, and one for the Management API (a third NuGet package named Auth0.Core is a dependency of both but provides no useful end-user features of its own).

### Installing Authentication API SDK

You can install the Authentication API SDK through the [Package Manager Console](https://docs.nuget.org/consume/Package-Manager-Console) inside Visual Studio:

```powershell
Install-Package Auth0.AuthenticationApi
```

Alternatively you can install it through the [Package Manager Dialog](https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-manager-dialog) by searching for the `Auth0.AuthenticationApi` package.

### Installing Management API SDK

You can install the Management API SDK through the [Package Manager Console](https://docs.nuget.org/consume/Package-Manager-Console) inside Visual Studio:

```powershell
Install-Package Auth0.ManagementApi
```

Alternatively you can install it through the [Package Manager Dialog](https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-manager-dialog) by searching for the `Auth0.ManagementApi` package.

## Using the Authentication API

This section will take your through the basics of using the Authentication API.

### Basic Usage

Ensure that you include the Authentication API namespace in your source code file:

```csharp
using Auth0.AuthenticationApi;
```

To start using the API, you need to create an instance of the @Auth0.AuthenticationApi.AuthenticationApiClient class, passing the URL of your Auth0 instance:

```csharp
var client = new AuthenticationApiClient("YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN");
```

> You can obtain your Auth0 Domain from the [Application section of the Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) in the settings for your particular application.

For more details on the various methods that are available, please refer to the documentation of the @Auth0.AuthenticationApi.AuthenticationApiClient class.

### Using URL Builders

Several helper methods are available to allow you to build URLs that you can redirect your user to for example to build up an authorization URL.

These methods follow a fluent syntax, meaning that you can keep chaining method calls together to build up the URL.

Finally, to build the actual URL, you will need to call the @Auth0.AuthenticationApi.Builders.UrlBuilderBase.Build method.

The following are the list of URL builder helper methods:

* @Auth0.AuthenticationApi.AuthenticationApiClientExtensions.BuildAuthorizationUrl
* @Auth0.AuthenticationApi.AuthenticationApiClientExtensions.BuildLogoutUrl
* @Auth0.AuthenticationApi.AuthenticationApiClientExtensions.BuildSamlUrl(System.String)
* @Auth0.AuthenticationApi.AuthenticationApiClientExtensions.BuildWsFedUrl

For example, to build up an authorization URL, you can write the following code:

```csharp
var client = new AuthenticationApiClient("YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN");

var authorizationUrl = client.BuildAuthorizationUrl()
	.WithResponseType(AuthorizationResponseType.Code)
	.WithClient("abcdef")
	.WithConnection("google-oauth2")
	.WithRedirectUrl("https://www.myapp.com/redirect")
	.WithScope("openid offline_access")
	.Build();
```

The sample code above will generate a URL for you to which you can redirect a user. For example, in an ASP.NET MVC Controller Action, you may do the following:

```csharp
public ActionResult Login() {
  var client = new AuthenticationApiClient("YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN");

  var authorizationUrl = client.BuildAuthorizationUrl()
    .WithResponseType(AuthorizationResponseType.Code)
    .WithClient("abcdef")
    .WithConnection("google-oauth2")
    .WithRedirectUrl("https://www.myapp.com/redirect")
    .WithScope("openid offline_access")
    .Build();

  return Redirect(authorizationUrl);
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to use the @Auth0.AuthenticationApi.Builders.AuthorizationUrlBuilder to construct the authorization URL and implement a login flow callback yourself, it is important to generate and store a state value using @Auth0.AuthenticationApi.Builders.AuthorizationUrlBuilder.WithState(System.String) and validate it in your callback URL before calling exchanging the authorization code for the tokens.

## Using the Management API

This section will take your through the basics of using the Management API.

### Basic Usage

Ensure that you include the Management API namespace in your source code file:

```csharp
using Auth0.ManagementApi;
```

To start using the API, you need to create an instance of the @Auth0.ManagementApi.ManagementApiClient class, passing a token and the URL to the Management API of your Auth0 instance:

```csharp
// Replace YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN with the domain of your Auth0 tenant, e.g. mycompany.auth0.com
var client = new ManagementApiClient("YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN", "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN");
```

> You can obtain your Auth0 Domain from the [Application section of the Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) in the settings for your particular application.

> [!NOTE]
> For details on how to generate the token, please see the [Access Token for the Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/tokens)

For more details on the various methods that are available, please refer to the documentation of the @Auth0.ManagementApi.ManagementApiClient class.

### Organization of the ManagementApiClient

In the screenshot of the API documentation below you can see that the API methods are organized by functional group, e.g Clients, Connections, Device Credentials, etc.

![](images/api-docs-structure.png)

The .NET Management API SDK also groups the API methods according to these functional groups. The functional groups are available as properties on the `ManagementApiClient` class, so you will for example find all Clients related API calls under the @Auth0.ManagementApi.ManagementApiClient.Clients property.

Below is an example of how you can get a list of all clients:

```csharp
// Replace YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN with the domain of your Auth0 tenant, e.g. mycompany.auth0.com
var apiClient = new ManagementApiClient("YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN", "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN");
var allClients = await apiClient.Clients.GetAllAsync();
```

### Client reuse and thread safety

`ManagementApiClient` and `AuthenticationApiClient` are thread-safe and while the client objects are lightweight to instantiate by default they create their own `HttpClientManagementConnection` and `HttpClientAuthenticationConnection` objects which in turn create their own `HttpClient`. In order to best utilize HTTP connections, the `HttpClient` should be shared as much as possible so it can perform the necessary thread-pooling.

Your choices are either to:

1. Share `ManagementApiClient` and `AuthenticationApiClient` across requests
2. Share `HttpClientManagementConnection` and `HttpClientAuthenticationConnection` across `ManagementApiClient` and `AuthenticationApiClient` instances
3. Share `HttpClient` between both `ManagementApiClient`, `AuthenticationApiClient` and optionally other libraries/your own usage. Make sure that no usage interferes with operation by reconfiguring default behavior.

e.g.

In your app start-up:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
    ...
    services.AddSingleton<IManagementConnection, HttpClientManagementConnection>();
}
```

In your controller:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public async Task<IActionResult> Get() {
  ...
  var managementConnection = services.Get<IManagementConnection>();
  var management = new ManagementApiClient("YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN", "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN", managementConnection);
  ...
}
```

`ManagementApiClient` and `AuthenticationApiClient` also implement `IDisposable` and it is good practice to dispose of them when you are done **if you are not sharing them** between requests.

When they have created their own `HttpClientManagementConnection` or `HttpClientAuthenticationConnection` they will dispose of them.  Any externally passed `IManagementConnection` or `IAuthenticationConnection` will not be disposed as it is assumed to be shared with other instances.

This also applies to whether a `HttpClientManagementConnection` or `HttpClientAuthenticationConnection` will dispose of a `HttpClient` or not - if they create it then will dispose it. If they are passed it they will not.

## Less-common scenarios

### Mocking the ManagementApiClient

While the `AuthenticationApiClient` has an associated `IAuthenticationApiClient` interface you will find that `ManagementApiClient` does not. The reason for this is that the such an interface would encompass the entire management API surface and that any change to the Management API would break existing users of that interface.

Instead, given that the Management API SDK is just a strongly-typed wrapper around the REST API, you can mock the @Auth0.ManagementApi.IManagementConnection interface which has just two methods:

1. `Task<T> GetAsync<T>(Uri uri, ...)` - To handle GET requests
2. `Task<T> SendAsync<T>(HttpMethod method, Uri uri, object body, ...)` - To handle POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE

### Using a proxy server

If you need to specify a Proxy Server, you can do so by making use of the @Auth0.AuthenticationApi.AuthenticationApiClient or @Auth0.ManagementApi.ManagementApiClient constructors which take a `HttpClientAuthenticationConnection` or `HttpClientManagementConnection` and create one to pass in giving your own `HttpMessageHandler` specifying the Proxy settings:

```csharp
var proxyHandler = new HttpClientHandler {
  Proxy = new WebProxy {
    Credentials = new NetworkCredential(username, password);
  }
};
var authenticationApiClient = new AuthenticationApiClient("YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN", new HttpClientAuthenticationConnection(proxyHandler));
```

### Passing extra headers

There are some instances where you may want to pass extra headers with the request. You can do so by making use of the @Auth0.AuthenticationApi.AuthenticationApiClient or @Auth0.ManagementApi.ManagementApiClient constructors which take a `HttpClientAuthenticationConnection` or `HttpClientManagementConnection` and create one to pass in giving your own `HttpMessageHandler` which adds the extra headers to all requests.

```csharp
// Create a new class which inherits from HttpMessageHandler (HttpClientHandler inherits from HttpMessageHandler)
class CustomMessageHandler : HttpClientHandler {
  protected override Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken token) {
    // Add extra header(s) to the request
    request.Headers.Add("auth0-forwarded-for", "189.214.5.210");
    return base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);
  }
}

// Somewhere else in your application, you can now pass an instance of this class to
// the constructor of AuthenticationApiClient or ManagementApiClient
var authenticationApiClient = new AuthenticationApiClient("YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN", new HttpClientAuthenticationConnection(new CustomMessageHandler()));
```
